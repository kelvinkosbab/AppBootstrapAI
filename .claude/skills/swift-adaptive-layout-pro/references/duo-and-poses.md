# iPhone Duo — arrangements, hinge, reserved regions, continuity

iPhone Duo is a book-style foldable: a 5.4″ outer display that behaves like a standard iPhone, and a 7.6″ inner display that reports **regular width and regular height**. Most Duo bugs are ordinary resizability bugs made visible on a phone; a smaller set are genuinely fold-specific.

> **iOS 27.1 surface.** `ArrangementView`, `onHingeChange`, reserved regions, and toolbar axis behavior ship in the iOS 27.1 SDK (Xcode 27.1). Verify spellings against the SDK in use before flagging their absence.

## Arrangements — the two-view container

```swift
ArrangementView {
    VideoPlayer(player: player)          // primary
} secondary: {
    PlaybackControls(player: player)     // secondary
}
.arrangementViewStyle(.split)            // or .overlay
```

- **`.split`** (default) divides the bounds, both regions unobscured. **`.overlay`** floats secondary over primary.
- **UIKit:** `UIArrangementViewController` as the **root view controller of a `UINavigationController`**, with primary and secondary view controllers.
- The canonical fit: media in primary, controls in secondary — in tabletop pose the content sits above the fold and the controls below it.

Findings to raise:

- **Navigation containers nested inside an arrangement**, or an **arrangement inside a `List` / scroll view** — both explicitly wrong; arrangements are layout, not navigation.
- **A hand-rolled split that reads the hinge angle to place its divider** — the arrangement adapts around available space *and* the fold already. Re-deriving it is fragile and drops the overlay case.
- **`ArrangementView` where `NavigationSplitView` fits better** — list+detail with selection and back behavior belongs to the split view; arrangements are for two co-resident views.
- **A missing `.arrangementViewStyle(...)` where overlay was intended** — the default is split, so an intended overlay silently renders as a division.

## The hinge is enhancement-only

```swift
.onHingeChange { _, context in
    if let hinge = context.hinge, hinge.status == .partiallyOpen {
        foldEffect = min(max(hinge.angle.degrees / 180, 0), 1)
    } else {
        foldEffect = 0
    }
}
```

- **`context.hinge` is optional.** Every non-folding device — and Duo's own outer display — has none. **Force-unwrapping it is a broken-tier finding** that breaks the whole rest of the lineup, not just an edge case.
- **Layout must never depend on the raw angle.** Structure comes from size classes and arrangements; the angle is animation input only (Apple's "unfold effect" treats the outer display as a window onto the inner one). Flag any layout branch keyed to `angle`.
- `hinge.status` is the coarse signal, `hinge.angle.degrees` the continuous one. Per-degree layout changes read as jitter.
- **Flag posture code that doesn't earn its place** — hinge observation on a settings or list screen is cost without benefit. Note its *absence* only on camera, video, and media screens, where the tabletop stand genuinely matters.

## Reserved regions — query, don't compute

```swift
GeometryReader { proxy in
    let divisions  = proxy.reservedRegions(kind: .division)
    let occlusions = proxy.reservedRegions(kind: .occlusion)
    // each exposes .frame, .margins, .isActive
}
```

- **`.division`** = content shouldn't straddle this (the fold). **`.occlusion`** = something covers the display here.
- Check **`.isActive`**; `.includeInactive` only when deliberately planning for a region not currently applied.
- **The high-value finding: an interactive control that can land in a division or occlusion.** A partially-closed device puts it underneath the fold — unreachable, and invisible to screenshot tests. Any custom layout computing the fold's position by hand instead of querying is the same finding upstream.

## Vertical toolbars

The inner display may lay toolbars out vertically. System containers handle it; per-item overrides exist for items that genuinely can't rotate:

- `.axisBehavior(.horizontalOnly)` / `.axisBehavior(.verticalPreferred)`
- `toolbarVerticalEdge` from the environment when content must know its edge
- `.toolbarVerticalBehavior(.disabled)` — last resort; flag it as a default

## Safe areas are asymmetric

```swift
// ❌ Assumes symmetry — off-center on Duo
let width = view.bounds.width - view.safeAreaInsets.left * 2
// ✅ Inset the rect, then measure it
let width = view.bounds.inset(by: view.safeAreaInsets).width
```

- UIKit: align foreground content to `view.bounds.inset(by: view.safeAreaInsets)`; let backgrounds extend beneath.
- SwiftUI: `.ignoresSafeArea()` on backgrounds only — never on content the user must reach.
- Corners: `ConcentricRectangle()` / `UICornerConfiguration` match the real screen corner. Grep for `safeAreaInsets.<edge>` used individually in arithmetic.

## Camera on two displays

- `CameraCaptureAccessory` for dual-display capture, `AVCaptureDeviceDirectionCoordinator` for device direction, `RotationCoordinator` for preview orientation across display changes.
- **The classic bug**: a preview sized from cached screen bounds or a fixed aspect ratio — stretched the moment the device unfolds. Camera code reading `UIScreen.main.bounds` is broken-tier.

## Continuity across fold and unfold

**The layout must survive every fold state and the transitions between them while state is live.** A fold is a configuration change under a running app.

Trace each of these across fold, unfold, and the outer↔inner switch:

- **Navigation depth + selection** — three screens deep stays three deep. On unfold a pushed detail should *become* the detail pane, not pop to the list. Custom navigation usually breaks this; test it explicitly.
- **Text entry and first responder**, including inside presented sheets.
- **Scroll position**, **media playback position**, **in-flight requests** (must not restart).
- **Session identity** — closing mid-task moves to the outer display; the session must not reset.
- **Visual stability** — no navigation jump, no re-animation. Interrupted animations and layout jumps mean the transition rebuilt instead of updated.

Where it breaks:

- **SwiftUI**: `@State` on a view replaced when the layout branch flips loses its value — hoist above the branch or key to content identity, not layout shape. `@SceneStorage` / an observable model for anything that must outlive re-composition.
- **UIKit**: update the existing hierarchy in `traitCollectionDidChange` / `viewWillTransition(to:with:)`; rebuilding drops first responder and scroll offsets.
- **Anything cached from old geometry** — a stored `isCompact`, a computed column count, a captured frame.
- **Fixed frames** clip as the window narrows — the most common visible symptom.

## Audit sequence

1. Two-view layouts → `ArrangementView` / `NavigationSplitView`? Check nesting constraints and the style modifier.
2. Every `onHingeChange` → optional unwrapped safely? Any layout keyed to `angle`?
3. Custom layouts → do they query `reservedRegions`, and can a control land in one?
4. Grep `safeAreaInsets.<edge>` in arithmetic; grep `UIScreen.main`.
5. Per screen, trace state across a fold: navigation, selection, text, scroll, playback, in-flight work.
6. Walk folded→unfolded *and* unfolded→folded navigation paths; name where continuity breaks.
7. Note what needs a physical device (below) rather than claiming simulator coverage.

## Simulator vs device

Xcode 27.1's Duo simulator folds/unfolds from toolbar buttons, and **⌥ Option gives a precise hinge-angle slider**. It does **not** cover: camera transitions between outer / inner / rear cameras, one-handed reachability in partially folded poses, haptics, thermal behavior, or how the fold physically looks. Recommend device time for those rather than signing off from the simulator.
